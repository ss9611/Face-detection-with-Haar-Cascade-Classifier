# Face-detection-with-Haar-Cascade-Classifier
Haar Cascade Classifier is a simple face detection method, and it may not always work perfectly, especially if the faces are not directly facing the camera or are under various lighting conditions. More advanced methods like deep learning-based face recognition models can provide better accuracy, but they require more complex setup and training.
